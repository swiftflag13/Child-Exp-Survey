    <h2>How to Understand Your Result:</h2>
    <p>Based on the complete state model of mental health, a person's mental health status is determined by the intersection of two separate indicators: the presence or absence of mental illness (psychopathology) and the presence or absence of subjective well-being (emotional, psychological, and social health).</p>
    <p>In the context of childhood development, this framework helps categorize how Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs)—such as abuse, neglect, or household dysfunction—and Benevolent Childhood Experiences (BCEs)—such as positive relationships and safe environments—interact to shape a child’s current state and future trajectory</p>
    <label for="result_type"></label><p> Your responses indicate that
    your childhood was characterized by: <select id="result_type">
        <option selected value="Flourishing">Flourishing</option>
        <option value="Languishing">Languishing</option>

    <div data-type="Flourishing">
    <h2>Flourishing Clients – Complete Mental Health:</h2>
    <p>Definition: This state is characterized by high levels of well-being and low levels of mental illness. A flourishing child experiences positive emotions, functions well psychologically and socially, and is free of significant psychopathology.</p>
    <p>Context of ACEs and BCEs: Flourishing is most often associated with high levels of BCEs, which provide the assets and resources necessary for optimal development. Even if a child has experienced some ACEs, the presence of strong BCEs (such as supportive relationships) can foster resilience, allowing the child to maintain high well-being.</p>
    <p>Implications for the Child: Flourishing youth exhibit the highest levels of psychosocial functioning, including high self-determination, closeness to others, and school integration. They report the fewest depressive symptoms and the lowest rates of conduct problems, such as substance use or truancy.</p>
    </div>
    <div data-type="Languishing">
    <h2>Languishing clients – Incomplete Mental Health:</h2>
    <p>Definition: This state is characterized by low levels of well-being and low levels of mental illness. While these children do not meet the criteria for a specific mental disorder, they lack positive mental health, feeling "empty," "stagnant," or devoid of vitality.</p>
    <p>Context of ACEs and BCEs: A child may be languishing due to a lack of BCEs (positive assets), even if they haven't experienced severe ACEs (trauma). Without the "assets" to build resources, a child may fail to thrive despite being free of illness.</p>
    <p>Implications for the Child: Languishing is a critical risk state. These youth report significantly higher rates of depressive symptoms and conduct problems (e.g., smoking, drinking, skipping school) compared to flourishing or moderately healthy peers. Languishing youth report the lowest levels of self-concept and school integration.</p>
    </div>
    <div data-type="Struggling">
    <h2>Struggling Clients – Incomplete Mental Illness:</h2>
    <p>Definition: This state is characterized by high levels of well-being despite high levels of mental illness. These individuals meet the diagnostic criteria for a mental disorder (e.g., depression or anxiety) but maintain a high degree of subjective well-being and positive functioning in other areas.</p>
    <p>Context of ACEs and BCEs: This state highlights the buffering power of BCEs. A child may experience the toxic stress of ACEs, leading to symptoms of mental illness, yet simultaneously possess enough BCEs (internal and external assets) to maintain hope, positive relationships, and psychological functioning.</p>
    <p>Implications for the Child: While these children suffer from symptoms of pathology, their high well-being acts as a protective factor. Research indicates that individuals who are flourishing (high well-being) but have an episode of mental illness function better—for example, missing fewer days of work or school—than those who are languishing while ill.</p>
    </div>
    <div data-type="Floundering">
    <h2>Floundering Clients – Complete Mental Illness</h2>
    <p>Definition: This state is characterized by low levels of well-being combined with high levels of mental illness. This represents the worst-case scenario, where an individual suffers from psychopathology and lacks the positive mental health resources to cope.</p>
    <p>Context of ACEs and BCEs: This state is often the result of the cumulative burden of high ACEs (toxic stress) and low BCEs (lack of support systems),. The absence of benevolent experiences leaves the child vulnerable to the full impact of trauma and deprivation.</p>
    <p>Implications for the Child: Children in this state experience the highest number of conduct problems and depressive symptoms,. They face severe deficits in psychosocial functioning and are at the highest risk for negative developmental outcomes.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Long-Term Implications for Adult Health</h2>
    <sub>The interplay of these states during childhood has profound implications for physical and mental health in adulthood:</sub>
    <h2>Mental Health Trajectory:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> <b>Languishing</b> is not benign; languishing adults are nearly six times more likely to be diagnosed with a major depressive episode later in life compared to flourishing adults.</li>
        <li><b>BCEs</b> (assets) in childhood are strongly inversely associated with mental health problems in young adulthood, including depression, anxiety, and PTSD.</li>
        <li><b>ACEs (adversities) are strongly linked to the development of mental illness, substance misuse, and suicide attempts in adulthood.</b></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Physical Health Trajectory:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Toxic Stress:</b> The toxic stress associated with high ACEs and a "floundering" state can alter brain development and immune system function. This correlates with a higher risk of chronic conditions in adulthood, including heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and asthma.</li>
        <li> <b>Protective Factors:</b> Conversely, flourishing (high well-being) predicts better physical health and fewer limitations in daily activities,. Preventing ACEs and promoting BCEs can reduce risky behaviors (like smoking and heavy drinking) and lower the risk of chronic diseases</li>
