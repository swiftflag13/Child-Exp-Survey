    <h1>The Complete State Mental Model of Childhood Experiences</h1>
</header>
<div class="page">

<p>Greetings! This survey blends two well-researched approaches to help give you a unique perspective on your experiences during your childhood. </p>
    <p>The complete state model of mental health frames psychological functioning along two
        distinct but related dimensions by evaluating a child’s condition based on both the
        presence of positive well-being along with the presence of mental illness or difficulties.
        This framework blends indicators of mental health challenges – in this case, this is
        measured by the Adverse Childhood Experiences Survey (ACES)—along with
        measures of psychological well-being, such as the Benevolent Childhood Experiences
        Survey (BCES) used in this survey. By assessing these factors simultaneously, the
        model categorizes youth into states ranging from &quot;flourishing&quot; (few mental health issues
        and high levels of positive functioning) to &quot;struggling&quot; (many mental health issues and
        low levels of positive functioning), acknowledging that a child may be free of mental
        illness yet still lack the positive mental health necessary for optimal development.</p>
<p>At the Center for Men’s Excellence, we see the importance of getting a clear sense of areas of difficulty – what’s “wrong” with a client – along with an equally clear sense of what’s “right” with someone. It’s essential to understand these multiple dimensions of anyone when working to support them in a way that results in lasting change and self-reliance. </p>
<p>So, we invite you to complete this brief survey to see which category of the mental health continua your childhood experiences map onto. Please note the following:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>This is a free, automated option – not psychotherapy, assessment, or a diagnosis</li>
        <li>Your responses are completely anonymous, and are not saved in our system</li>
    </ol>
